# About Tickets System

The tickets system manages work items as Markdown files in the `_tickets/` directory, each with YAML frontmatter containing fields such as `code`, `name`, `ticket_status`, `ticket_priority`, and `ticket_rank`. Tickets progress through statuses: `[[Backlog]]` (unscheduled), `[[Ready]]` (scheduled), `[[In Progress]]` (active work), `[[Complete]]` (done), `[[Duplicate]]`, and `[[Won't Fix]]`. A `tickets` CLI provides `list`, `validate`, and `create` subcommands for managing tickets.
